# neonCalculator

##### Day 01/40 

Today I built a quite simple calculator however it made me realize that I had to reinforce some topics.

###### CHALLENGES

Loops: 

And it is that the loops are an easy thing when we use the tap key but it needed a little of my attention so as not to depend on any key (I hate you tab key, I really love my dog 🤷‍♂️💕  ).

###### ACQUIRED SKILLS: 

Programmation logic: 

Without a doubt, my logic has evolved, I'm not the same, now I know how to fix my mistakes 🕷️ I'm the best (the truth is that I'm not that good, but I've improved, I have a long way to go, all for not coming back with C )


In summary, I have nothing more to say, it has been an effortless project but at the same time challenging.
This was the first day, I still have 39 more to go, but I'm not giving up.

bye bye! ✌️✌️

I got an email from tab key to publicly apologize sorry it was a lie love you tap key ❤️❤️❤️❤️
